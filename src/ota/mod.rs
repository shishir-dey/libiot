//! # Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Agent
//!
//! This module provides a network-agnostic OTA update mechanism inspired by the
//! AWS IoT Core OTA service. It is designed to be portable and work with any
//! network stack that implements the `libiot::network` traits.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The OTA agent is designed as a state machine that is driven by events. The
//! agent can be in one of the following states:
//!
//! * `Idle`: The agent is waiting for an update.
//! * `Downloading`: The agent is downloading the firmware image.
//! * `Verifying`: The agent is verifying the integrity of the firmware image.
//! * `Activating`: The agent is activating the new firmware image.
//!
//! The agent transitions between states based on events that it receives. The
//! following events are supported:
//!
//! * `UpdateAvailable`: A new firmware update is available.
//! * `DownloadComplete`: The firmware image has been successfully downloaded.
//! * `VerificationComplete`: The firmware image has been successfully verified.
//! * `ActivationComplete`: The new firmware image has been successfully activated.
//!
//! The OTA agent is designed to be used with a `Platform` trait that provides
//! platform-specific functionality, such as saving the firmware image to flash
//! storage and rebooting the device.
